# Experiment Report Naming

## Overview

This document describes the naming convention for experiment reports generated by the `ExperimentSeriesRunner`. Reports are stored as JSON files that track the status of multiple experiments in a series.

## Naming Convention

Experiment report files follow this naming pattern:
```
<base_dir>/<experiment_name>_<timestamp>/experiment_report.json
```

Where:
- `base_dir`: The base directory specified in the experiment config
- `experiment_name`: The name from the experiment config file (preferred) or the series name provided via CLI argument (fallback)
- `timestamp`: A timestamp in the format YYYYMMDD_HH

## Priority Order

The report directory name is determined with the following priority:

1. Use `experiment.name` from the config file if available
2. Fall back to the `series_name` provided via CLI argument if available
3. Use "experiment_series" as the default if nothing else is specified

## Example

Given:
- Config file with `experiment.name = "Emotional_Response_Effects"`
- CLI command: `python -m neuro_manipulation.run_experiment_series --config config.yaml --name "CLI_Series_Name"`

The report will be stored at:
```
<base_dir>/Emotional_Response_Effects_20250210_163355/experiment_report.json
```

In this example, the name from the config file takes precedence over the CLI argument.

## Relation to Individual Experiment Outputs

This naming convention ensures that experiment reports are stored consistently with individual experiment outputs from the `EmotionGameExperiment` class, which also uses the experiment name from the config file in its directory structure.

## Changes in v0.2.1

Previously, experiment reports were stored using only the `series_name` argument, which led to inconsistencies with the individual experiment output directories. This has been fixed to prioritize the experiment name from the config file to ensure consistent directory structures.
