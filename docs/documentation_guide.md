# Project Documentation (`docs`)

This directory contains the source Markdown files for the project documentation.
The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

## Building the Documentation Locally

To build and serve the documentation locally for development and preview:

1.  **Ensure MkDocs is installed**:
    If you haven't already, install MkDocs and the Material theme (preferably in your project's Python virtual environment):
    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
    ```
    (Remember to activate your conda environment first if you're using one, e.g., `conda activate llm`)

2.  **Navigate to the project root**:
    Open your terminal in the root directory of this project (where `mkdocs.yml` is located).

3.  **Serve the documentation**:
    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
    This will start a local development server. You can view the documentation by opening your web browser to the address shown in the output (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). The site will automatically rebuild and reload when you save changes to the documentation files or `mkdocs.yml`.

4.  **Stop the local server**:
    Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `mkdocs serve` is running.

## Building Static HTML Files

To generate the static HTML files (e.g., for deployment to a web server or GitHub Pages):

1.  **Navigate to the project root**.
2.  **Run the build command**:
    ```bash
    mkdocs build
    ```
    This will create a `site` directory in your project root containing the complete static documentation website. You can then deploy the contents of this `site` directory.

## Editing Content

-   **Source Files**: All documentation content is in Markdown files (`.md`) within this `docs` directory and its subdirectories (like `docs/reference`).
-   **Navigation**: The site navigation is defined in the `nav` section of the `mkdocs.yml` file in the project root.
-   **Configuration**: Site appearance, plugins, and other settings are configured in `mkdocs.yml`.

## Adding New Pages

1.  Create a new Markdown file (e.g., `docs/reference/new_topic.md`).
2.  Add your content to the new file.
3.  Update the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml` to include a link to your new page.

## Committing Documentation Changes

Remember to commit changes to:
-   The Markdown files in the `docs` directory.
-   The `mkdocs.yml` configuration file if you change navigation or site settings.
-   Any new assets (like images) added to the `docs` directory.

Do NOT commit the `site` directory generated by `mkdocs build` unless you have a specific reason for doing so (e.g., deploying via GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch or a `docs` folder on `main`, depending on your setup).
