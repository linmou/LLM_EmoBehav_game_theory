## Why These Files Are Preserved

While the main **GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION_COMPLETE.md** provides excellent high-level coverage, these archive files contain:

1. **Implementation-level technical details** needed for future maintenance
2. **Testing procedures and verification commands** for troubleshooting
3. **Historical context** showing the evolution of the implementation
4. **Code snippets and mathematical explanations** for understanding the algorithms
5. **Detailed performance metrics** for future benchmarking

## Usage
