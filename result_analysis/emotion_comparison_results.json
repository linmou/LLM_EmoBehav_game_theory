(2) A joint exhibition can be a high-risk, high-reward strategy, potentially drawing significant attention and resentment from the art community if one museum feels the other is not contributing equally. (3) The resentment from the art community can be mitigated by clear communication, equal contributions, and a fair distribution of responsibilities. (4) In case of a joint exhibition, the following can be the possible outcomes: - The two museums can share the costs associated with the exhibition. - The exhibition can be more comprehensive, including more pieces from the collections of both museums. - The exhibition can be more likely to attract a wider audience, including people who may not be familiar with either museum. (5) The following are the possible negative outcomes of a joint exhibition: - The two museums can have conflicting opinions on the organization and management of the exhibition, leading to frustration and resentment. - The joint exhibition can be perceived as a sign of weakness, particularly if one museum feels that the other is dominating the exhibition. - The joint exhibition can be a high-risk strategy, as the museums may not be able to manage the associated costs and stress."
