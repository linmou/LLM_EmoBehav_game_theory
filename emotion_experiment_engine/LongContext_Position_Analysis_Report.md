## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of which tasks in LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks are suitable for answer position analysis. Through examination of 40+ benchmark files and research of both benchmark architectures, we identify the most promising tasks for studying positional bias in long-context language model evaluation.

**Key Finding**: 6 tasks demonstrate excellent position retrievability, with 3 high-priority candidates offering distinct analysis approaches: paragraph-level positions, character-level needle-in-haystack, and structured data retrieval.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis Approach
1. **File Structure Analysis**: Examined all `.jsonl` files in `test_data/real_benchmarks/`
2. **Task Categorization**: Classified tasks by answer position dependency
3. **Benchmark Research**: Investigated original benchmark papers and documentation
4. **Position Mapping Assessment**: Evaluated feasibility of mapping answers to text positions

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Position Explicitness**: How clearly can answer positions be determined?
- **Context Length**: Longer contexts enable better position bias detection
- **Answer Format**: Structured answers enable precise position mapping
- **Task Design**: Tasks specifically requiring positional information retrieval

## High-Priority Tasks (⭐⭐⭐)

### 1. LongBench Passage Retrieval Tasks

**Files:**
- `longbench_passage_retrieval_en.jsonl`
- `longbench_passage_retrieval_zh.jsonl`

**Task Description:**
- Find which numbered paragraph contains the answer to a given question
- Answer format: "Paragraph N" where N is the paragraph number

**Position Analysis Potential:**
```
✅ Excellent - Explicit paragraph numbering
✅ Discrete positions mapped to continuous text positions
✅ Relative position calculation: (paragraph_num - 1) / (total_paragraphs - 1)
✅ Character-level position mapping available
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "input": "Question about content...",
  "context": "Paragraph 1: ... Paragraph 2: ... Paragraph 15: ...",
  "answers": ["Paragraph 15"]
}
```

**Analysis Insights:**
- Average 6,711 words (English) / 13,386 characters (Chinese)
- ~20-30 paragraphs per context
- Position bias can be measured at both paragraph-level and character-level

### 2. InfiniteBench PassKey Retrieval

**File:** `infinitebench_passkey.jsonl`

**Task Description:**
- Find a hidden passkey (e.g., "71432") embedded within extremely long, repetitive noise text
- Classic "needle in haystack" evaluation

**Position Analysis Potential:**
```
✅ Perfect - Needle at specific character positions
✅ 100K+ token contexts enable precise position measurement
✅ Binary success/failure with exact position tracking
✅ Minimal context variation - pure position dependency
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "context": "The pass key is 71432. Remember it. 71432 is the pass key. The grass is green...",
  "input": "What is the pass key?",
  "answer": "71432"
}
```

**Analysis Insights:**
- Context length: 100K+ tokens
- Passkey typically appears early in context but surrounded by noise
- Direct character position mapping: `position = context.find(answer) / len(context)`

### 3. InfiniteBench Key-Value Retrieval

**File:** `infinitebench_kv_retrieval.jsonl`

**Task Description:**
- Extract specific values from large JSON-like structured data using keys
- Requires precise navigation through structured long contexts

**Position Analysis Potential:**
```
✅ Excellent - Structured position mapping
✅ UUID keys provide exact position anchors
✅ 100K+ token contexts with clear structure
✅ Multiple position types: JSON structure + character positions
```

**Sample Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "context": "JSON data:\n{\"uuid1\": \"value1\", \"uuid2\": \"value2\", ...}",
  "input": "What is the value of uuid1?",
  "answer": "value1"
}
```

**Analysis Insights:**
- Highly structured data enables multiple position metrics
- Key-value pairs distributed throughout large JSON objects
- Both structural position (key index) and character position available

---

## Medium-Priority Tasks (⭐⭐)

### 4. LongBench Passage Count
**File:** `longbench_passage_count.jsonl`
- Count occurrences across multiple passages
- Moderate position dependency for comprehensive counting

### 5. Multi-Document QA Tasks
**Files:** `longbench_hotpotqa.jsonl`, `longbench_2wikimqa.jsonl`
- Information spans multiple document sections
- Moderate position tracking through document boundaries

### 6. InfiniteBench Code Debug
**File:** `infinitebench_code_debug.jsonl`
- Bug locations within long code files
- Line number positions provide discrete position mapping

---

## Lower-Priority Tasks (⭐)

### Content Understanding Tasks
- **Choice Tasks**: Multiple choice focuses on comprehension, not position
- **Summarization Tasks**: Require global understanding rather than position-specific retrieval
- **Math/Logic Tasks**: Answer depends on reasoning, not information location

---

## Position Bias Patterns to Investigate

### 1. Beginning Bias (Primacy Effect)
- **Hypothesis**: Models retrieve information more accurately from early context
- **Measurement**: Higher success rates for answers in first 25% of context
- **Tasks**: All three high-priority tasks

### 2. Recency Bias  
- **Hypothesis**: Recent information more accessible than middle content
- **Measurement**: Higher success rates for answers in final 25% of context
- **Tasks**: Particularly relevant for PassKey and KV-Retrieval

### 3. "Lost in the Middle" Phenomenon
- **Hypothesis**: Information in middle 25%-75% of context harder to retrieve
- **Measurement**: Performance degradation in middle positions
- **Tasks**: Critical for 100K+ token InfiniteBench tasks

### 4. Structural Anchor Effects
- **Hypothesis**: Structured markers (paragraph numbers, JSON keys) improve retrieval
- **Measurement**: Compare success rates near vs. far from structural markers
- **Tasks**: Passage Retrieval (paragraphs) vs. KV-Retrieval (JSON structure)

## Technical Implementation Recommendations

### Position Metrics to Calculate

```python
# Character-level positions (0.0 to 1.0)
relative_char_pos = answer_char_position / total_context_length

# Structural positions
relative_paragraph_pos = (paragraph_num - 1) / (total_paragraphs - 1)
json_key_index = list(json_keys).index(target_key) / len(json_keys)

# Position bins for analysis
position_quartiles = ['beginning', 'early_middle', 'late_middle', 'end']
```

### Statistical Analyses to Perform

1. **Position Distribution Analysis**
   - Histogram of answer positions
   - Chi-square test against uniform distribution
   - Mean/median position calculations

2. **Performance vs. Position Correlation**
   - Success rate by position quartile
   - Linear regression: position → accuracy
   - Position bias coefficient calculation

3. **Cross-Task Position Comparison**
   - Position bias patterns across different task types
   - Task-specific vs. universal position effects
   - Context length impact on position bias

### Visualization Recommendations

1. **Position Heatmaps**: Answer frequency by relative position
2. **Performance Curves**: Accuracy vs. position across context length
3. **Bias Comparison Charts**: Position bias across different tasks
4. **Context Length Impact**: How bias changes with longer contexts

## Expected Research Insights

### Fundamental Questions to Answer

1. **Is there a universal "lost in the middle" effect?**
   - Consistent across task types?
   - Scales with context length?

2. **How do structural markers affect retrieval?**
   - Do paragraph numbers improve middle-context retrieval?
   - JSON structure vs. free text position bias?

## Conclusion

The three high-priority tasks offer complementary perspectives on position bias:

1. **Passage Retrieval**: Discrete structural positions in moderate-length contexts
2. **PassKey**: Pure needle-in-haystack in extremely long contexts  
3. **KV-Retrieval**: Structured data navigation in long contexts

This combination enables comprehensive analysis of how large language models handle positional information across different context types and lengths, providing crucial insights for both benchmark design and model evaluation methodology.

The existing `analyze_passage_retrieval_positions.py` script provides an excellent foundation that can be expanded to create a unified position analysis framework for all identified high-priority tasks.
