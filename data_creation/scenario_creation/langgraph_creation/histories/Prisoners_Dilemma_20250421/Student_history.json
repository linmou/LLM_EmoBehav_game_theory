The dilemma arises with the decision to either return the books on time, ensuring both have fair access to all materials, or to keep them longer for personal advantage, potentially disadvantaging the other. If both return the books, both can share resources effectively. If one keeps the books, they gain an advantage while the other suffers. If both keep the books, neither gains much as they are missing other needed resources.",
