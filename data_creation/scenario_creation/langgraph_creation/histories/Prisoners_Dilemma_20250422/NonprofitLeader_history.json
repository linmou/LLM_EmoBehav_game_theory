Alternatively, you can each propose individual projects for different community areas. If both choose to collaborate, the park is fully renovated, benefiting the community. If one proposes a separate project while the other collaborates, the individual project receives full funding and acclaim, while the collaborator's proposal is left unfunded. If both propose separate projects, the grant is split, leading to modest improvements but not significant community impact.",
