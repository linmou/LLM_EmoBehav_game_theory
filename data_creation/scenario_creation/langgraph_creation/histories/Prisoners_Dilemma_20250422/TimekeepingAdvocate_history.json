The process of digitization is costly and time-consuming but offers the potential of increased international recognition and accessibility to your collections. If both museums decide to digitize and share, they will both benefit from enhanced reputations and heightened interest from global audiences. However, if one museum chooses to delay digitization and instead focuses on exclusive physical exhibitions, it can capitalize on the appeal of exclusivity, attracting more visitors and maintaining its cultural prestige. Meanwhile, the museum that chose to digitize will lose a portion of its physical visitors to the competitor. If both museums delay digitization, they will maintain their current visitor numbers, but miss out on the opportunities for international acclaim and digital engagement.",
