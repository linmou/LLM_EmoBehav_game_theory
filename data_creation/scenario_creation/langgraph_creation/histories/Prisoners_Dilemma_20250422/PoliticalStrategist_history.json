You can choose to focus on positive messaging that highlights your candidate's strengths, hoping to inspire voters and improve public perception. Alternatively, you can launch negative ads aimed at undermining Bob's candidate. If both strategists choose positivity, both campaigns benefit from enhanced public esteem and voter engagement. However, if one chooses negativity while the other remains positive, the attacker sways undecided voters at the expense of the other's candidate. If both resort to negativity, mutual damage ensues, leading to widespread voter disillusionment.",
