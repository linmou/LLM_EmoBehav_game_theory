If both gyms participate fully in the initiative by offering free community classes and workshops, it will foster a strong sense of community, attract new members, and enhance your reputations as community leaders. However, if you decide to focus solely on your gym's profit by not participating while Bob engages fully, your gym may experience short-term financial gains, but this could lead to negative community sentiment towards you for not supporting the initiative. Conversely, if Bob chooses to prioritize his profits, he may gain some immediate financial benefits, but at the cost of community trust. If both gyms opt out of the initiative, it could lead to a decline in overall community health, and both of your businesses could suffer as a result of losing potential members who value community involvement.
