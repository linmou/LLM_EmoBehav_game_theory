Sharing more detailed information could help Bob enhance his performance during the race. After the event, Bob can choose how much of his firsthand experience—such as newly discovered shortcuts or unexpected terrain challenges—he wishes to share back with Alice to aid her future training. Both athletes’ decisions about information sharing affect their race outcomes and influence ongoing mutual perceptions in this competitive yet somewhat cooperative setting.",
