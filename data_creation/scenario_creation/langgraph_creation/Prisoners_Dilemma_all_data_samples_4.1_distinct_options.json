        "description": "In the midst of escalating regional tensions, you and Bob are trusted as national military analysts to attend a high-level international defense panel. The panel requests the latest satellite imagery of disputed zones to coordinate non-conflicting humanitarian aid. You both must independently decide whether to provide high-resolution classified images for the communal strategy session or stick to standard, publicly available updates. Full sharing could benefit both sides through improved planning and increased trust, but with the risk of giving away sensitive capabilities. If only one of you fully shares, their country stands to lose strategic value, while the other quietly reaps extensive benefits. If neither takes the risk, everyone loses out on critical insights, hampering the assembled team's effort and drawing criticism for missed opportunities.",

The exhibition is fiercely competitive, and judges highly value originality and depth in illustration. You may choose to share your rare orchid findings with Bob before the submission deadline, potentially allowing both of your works to improve. However, if one of you shares while the other withholds, the one who keeps their material private can leverage the extra information for a significant advantage, possibly sweeping up all major accolades. If both refuse to share, you each end up with competent but standard entries, earning lukewarm responses.",
