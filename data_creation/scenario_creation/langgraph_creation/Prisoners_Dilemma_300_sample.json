You can either invest in a joint community wellness program to enhance your facilities\u2019 appeal or dedicate funds to marketing campaigns aimed at attracting new residents. If both invest in wellness programs, you maintain a steady flow of residents with improved community reputation. If one chooses marketing while the other invests in wellness, the marketer gains more residents while the other loses potential clients. If both choose marketing, competition intensifies, yielding only moderate gains for both.",
