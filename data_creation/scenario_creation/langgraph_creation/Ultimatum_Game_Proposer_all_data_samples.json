Alice proposes a weekly microscope usage schedule dividing the available hours between the two labs. Bob can either accept the schedule, ensuring both labs stay on track, or reject it, which prompts the facility manager to suspend all bookings and redistribute microscope time randomly. This random reassignment risks delays and complications for both labs, potentially impacting their research outcomes and future funding opportunities.",

Alice needs more wall space to display her large canvas series, which she hopes will attract significant gallery sponsorship and media attention. Bob, on the other hand, wants enough space to cover his production costs through potential sales, with his artworks arranged on contiguous walls to maintain their thematic flow. The gallery layout consists of four contiguous walls forming a square room. Alice proposes the division of wall space in percentages. Bob can either accept this division or reject it.

        "description": "In a small town's postal office, Alice and Bob are the only postal workers responsible for delivering mail each week. There are 10 shifts that must be covered to ensure timely delivery to the community. Alice proposes a division of these shifts between herself and Bob. After reviewing the proposal, Bob decides whether to accept or reject it. If Bob accepts, the shifts are assigned as proposed and both receive their full weekly wages. If Bob rejects, no mail deliveries will occur that week, resulting in both losing their wages and causing inconvenience to the town's residents who rely on the postal service.",

Once Alice presents her plan, Bob reviews the allocation and must decide whether to greenlight the proposal so upgrades move forward, or to request a committee review. If Bob requests a review, the committee will revoke the funding, and neither group will receive any equipment upgrades this cycle.
