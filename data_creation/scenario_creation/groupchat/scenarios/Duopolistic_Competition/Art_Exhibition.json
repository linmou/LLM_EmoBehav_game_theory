    "description": "Two artists, You and Bob, are invited to an exclusive art exhibition where they must decide how to display their artwork. Each can choose either an avant-garde or a classic style. If both choose avant-garde, they attract a niche audience and share moderate fame. If one chooses avant-garde while the other chooses classic, the avant-garde artist becomes the talk of the town. If both choose classic, they enjoy a steady but unremarkable reception.",
