    "description": "Two art galleries are planning their upcoming exhibitions. Each can choose to feature modern art or classical art. If both choose modern art, they attract a similar audience and share profits. If one chooses modern while the other opts for classical, the gallery with classical art attracts a unique audience and gains more visitors. If both choose classical art, they compete for the same niche audience and earn lower profits.",
