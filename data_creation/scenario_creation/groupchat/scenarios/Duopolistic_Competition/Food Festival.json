    "description": "Two food vendors at a festival must choose between serving gourmet dishes or street food. If both serve gourmet, they cater to a smaller crowd and share decent profits. If one serves gourmet while the other serves street food, the street food vendor attracts more festival-goers. If both serve street food, they compete directly and earn less.",
