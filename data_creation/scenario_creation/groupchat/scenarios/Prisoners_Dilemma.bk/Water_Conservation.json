    "description": "Two farmers with adjacent lands must decide whether to conserve water during a drought or use as much as they need. If both conserve, the water lasts longer for both. If one conserves while the other doesn't, the non-conserver benefits while the conserver risks crop loss. If neither conserves, the water runs out quickly.",
