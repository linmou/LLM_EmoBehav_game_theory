    "description": "Two explorers must decide whether to collaborate on finding a hidden treasure or individually collect smaller artifacts. If both work together on the treasure, they succeed and share a large reward. If one goes for the treasure while the other collects artifacts, the treasure seeker fails while the artifact collector gets a small reward. If both collect artifacts, they both get moderate rewards.",
