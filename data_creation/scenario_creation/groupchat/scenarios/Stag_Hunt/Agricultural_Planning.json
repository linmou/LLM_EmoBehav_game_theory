    "description": "Two farmers must decide whether to collaborate on growing a high-yield crop or individually work on low-yield crops. If both grow the high-yield crop, they succeed and receive a large reward. If one grows the high-yield crop while the other grows low-yield crops, the high-yield crop fails while the low-yield crop farmer gets a small reward. If both grow low-yield crops, they both receive moderate rewards.",
