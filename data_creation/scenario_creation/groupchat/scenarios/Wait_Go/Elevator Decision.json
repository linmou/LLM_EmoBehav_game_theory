    "scenario": "Elevator Decision",
    "description": "Two individuals arrive at an elevator simultaneously on different floors. Each must decide whether to hold the elevator for the other or proceed to their destination. If both hold, there's a slight delay. If both proceed, they miss the chance to ride together. If one holds while the other proceeds, the elevator ride is efficient.",
