    "scenario": "Visa Application Process",
    "description": "Two immigration lawyers, 'You' and 'Bob', are responsible for preparing visa applications for a mutual client with a tight deadline. Each lawyer must decide whether to collaborate fully with each other or focus solely on their own tasks. If both collaborate, the applications are error-free and submitted early, enhancing their reputation. If one collaborates while the other doesn\u2019t, the collaborator feels overburdened while the non-collaborator benefits from reduced workload. If neither collaborates, the applications are submitted late with errors, risking the client\u2019s chance of approval.",
