    "description": "Two community organizers, You and Bob, are planning a local festival. They must decide whether to invest more in entertainment or stick to the planned budget. If both invest more, the festival is a hit but funds are depleted. If one invests more while the other doesn't, the investor gains more recognition. If neither invests more, the festival is modest but within budget.",
