    "description": "Two marketing managers are tasked with launching a new product. Each must decide whether to share their market research with the other. If both share, they can create a comprehensive strategy and achieve high sales. If one shares while the other doesn't, the sharer feels exploited while the non-sharer gains an edge. If neither shares, they achieve average sales.",
