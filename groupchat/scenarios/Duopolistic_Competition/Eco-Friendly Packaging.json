    "description": "Two companies are deciding on their packaging strategy. Each can choose recyclable materials or biodegradable materials. If both choose recyclable, they share the eco-conscious market. If one chooses biodegradable while the other sticks to recyclable, the biodegradable packager attracts more eco-conscious consumers. If both choose biodegradable, they face higher costs and lower profits.",
