    "description": "Two designers are participating in a fashion show. Each can choose to showcase either avant-garde designs or classic styles. If both choose avant-garde, they appeal to a limited audience and share moderate acclaim. If one chooses avant-garde while the other opts for classic, the classic designer gains more media coverage. If both choose classic styles, they compete for the same audience and receive less recognition.",
