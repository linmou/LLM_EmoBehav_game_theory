If both work on the groundbreaking experiment, they succeed and share a significant discovery. If one works on the groundbreaking experiment while the other conducts smaller experiments, the groundbreaking experiment scientist fails while the small experiment scientist gets a minor discovery. If both conduct smaller experiments, they both achieve moderate discoveries.",
