    "description": "Two explorers, You and Bob, must decide whether to collaborate on digging for a hidden treasure or search for smaller treasures individually. If both dig for the hidden treasure, they succeed and share a large reward. If one digs for the hidden treasure while the other searches for smaller treasures, the hidden treasure digger fails while the small treasure searcher gets a small reward. If both search for smaller treasures, they both get moderate rewards.",
