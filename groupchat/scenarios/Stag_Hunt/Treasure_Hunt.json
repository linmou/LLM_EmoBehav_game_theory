    "description": "Two treasure hunters must decide whether to collaborate on finding a hidden treasure chest or individually search for smaller treasures. If both collaborate, they succeed and share a large treasure. If one collaborates while the other searches individually, the collaborator fails while the solo hunter finds a small treasure. If both search individually, they both find moderate treasures.",
