    "description": "Two archaeologists must decide whether to collaborate on excavating a large artifact or individually work on smaller, less significant digs. If both excavate the artifact, they succeed and share a large reward. If one excavates the artifact while the other works on smaller digs, the excavator fails while the individual worker gets a small reward. If both work on smaller digs, they both get moderate rewards.",
