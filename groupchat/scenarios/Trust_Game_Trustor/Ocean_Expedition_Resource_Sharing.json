  "scenario": "Ocean_Expedition_Resource_Sharing",
  "description": "Jessy, an oceanographer, embarks on an expedition with limited resources for exploring a remote marine habitat. She can share some of her equipment with Bob, a fellow researcher, to aid in his parallel studies. Sharing resources increases the potential data gathered (e.g., a camera shared can result in multiple data points collected). Bob decides how much of the data he shares back with Jessy.",
