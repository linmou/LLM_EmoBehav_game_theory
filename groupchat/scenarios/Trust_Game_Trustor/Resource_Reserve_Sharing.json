    "description": "You have control over a water reserve and can decide how much to share with a neighboring village facing a shortage. The shared water multiplies issues resolved (e.g., 1 unit \u2192 3 resolved issues). The neighbor then decides how much gratitude they will express back to complete your water reservoir system.",
